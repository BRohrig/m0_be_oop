# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I have struggled with this for 3 days now and am definitely in the "unproductive struggle" mode. Help from others and the internet is failing me because it's not the concepts that I'm struggling with, it's the basic syntax and code composition rules that I have no clue of that are messing me up.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
It's ok, I'm getting up and taking breaks when needed, I have much more fundamental issues with this material.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
A little bit of coding basics. What the symbols mean, what the rules are for putting things together. I have ideas of HOW to do things, but translating the conceptual side into actual working code isn't happening, because I don't know what I'm doing at a very basic level.
